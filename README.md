This code takes the dynamical matrix files from QUANTUM ESPRESSO calculations and computes the Gamma or q-point grid averaged zero point energy. Formatting requirements are as follows:

* "fildyn" can be set in line 21, filename = "dyn"+str(i+1). Just change the name in quotations to the setting in your ph.x input file
