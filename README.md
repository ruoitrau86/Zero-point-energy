# Zero point energy calculator

This code takes the dynamical matrix files from QUANTUM ESPRESSO calculations and computes the Gamma or q-point grid averaged zero point energy. Formatting requirements are as follows:

* "fildyn" can be set in lines 25 (Gamma-point) and 35 (q-point grid) by modifying "dyn" in the source code to fit your naming scheme. For Gamma-point calculations, don't forget to apply acoustic sum rules.

Please report bugs to rwexler@sas.upenn.edu. Enjoy!
